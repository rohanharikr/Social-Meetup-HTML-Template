# Social Meetup HTML TailwindCSS Template

![Preview Image](preview.png) 

Social Meetup is a responsive and color palette customizable web template, and is made using TailwindCSS. The template includes three pages - home, about, and contact; with a dedicated mobile menu for each and slick animations!

Editing the color palettes at assets/css/colors.css will take effect across all the pages including the graphics.
All assets used in the project can be found in the assets directory.
